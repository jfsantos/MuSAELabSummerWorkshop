This repository hosts the material used for our internal Summer Workshop. All the material is available under the Creative Commons - Attribution License (except the IPython notebooks used for the Python section, which are under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike license).

The workshop website was generated using the infrastructure provided by Software Carpentry for their bootcamps (note that our workshop is *not* sponsored by Software Carpentry). The scripts used to generate the website are under the MIT license. 

The material on Python comes from the [Advanced Statistical Computing course by Christopher Fonnesbeck](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios366). Some adaptations were done, namely adding some examples and material on the signal processing functions in Scipy.

The material on Git is exactly the one used at Software Carpentry bootcamps.

The IPython notebooks and Python examples for the Best Practices section are based on the paper ["Best Practices for Scientific Computing"](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745), by Greg Wilson et al. Additionally, some text excerpts come from a [presentation](https://github.com/UW-Madison-ACI/boot-camps/raw/2014-08-04-Davidson/BestPractices.pdf) about the same paper, prepared by Paul Wilson for a Software Carpentry bootcamp in UW-Madison. Thanks to Greg Wilson and Paul Wilson for the suggestions and feedback on this part of the material.
